StringSearch
============

A string search program that takes in a string of letters separated by spaces and checks if a given word contains each of the letters, in the given order, but potentially with characters preceding or following each of the letters that are being checked for.

It is the sister-project of [MakerWord](https://github.com/hamchapman/MakerWord), which heavily relies on the code in this project to create the dictionaries it uses, as well as the string search function itself.
